// This file can include functions for the skill-based matching algorithm.
// For example, you might write a function to compare a user's offered skills with other users' desired skills
// and return a list of potential matches.

// Example function (placeholder):
function getPotentialMatches($userId, $pdo) {
    // Query the database to find matches based on skills
    // Return an array of matching user IDs or details.
    return [];
}
