SkillSwap
A Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform

Introduction

This document proposes the development of SkillSwap, a web-based peer-to-peer learning platform. SkillSwap aims to provide an accessible and cost-effective way for individuals to exchange knowledge and skills in a collaborative learning environment.
Problem Statement
Many students and professionals seek to acquire new skills or enhance existing ones to improve their academic and career prospects. However, access to quality learning resources is often limited by high costs, geographical constraints, or a lack of personalized learning experiences.
Existing learning platforms primarily focus on structured courses, often overlooking the potential of peer-to-peer learning. SkillSwap addresses this gap by enabling individuals to connect, learn, and share knowledge directly with others. The project will incorporate key principles of database design, matchmaking algorithms, and user interface development to create an efficient skill exchange platform.


Project Objectives
Skill-Based Matching – Develop a keyword-based algorithm to connect users based on the skills they offer and wish to learn, while considering their availability.
User Engagement Features – Design essential features such as user profiles, skill listings, and session scheduling to facilitate seamless interaction.
Feedback Mechanism – Implement a simple post-session feedback system to allow users to rate and review their learning experiences.
Prototype Development – Build a functional web-based prototype to demonstrate the core concept of peer-to-peer skill swapping.
Proposed Solution
SkillSwap will be developed as a web-based platform with a focus on user-friendliness, responsiveness, and scalability.
Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML & CSS – Used for designing the user interface and styling the platform.
Backend: PHP – Handles server-side logic and processes user requests.
Database: MySQL (hosted on Apache) – Stores user data, skill listings, session information, and feedback.
Core Features
User Profiles & Skill Listings – Users can create profiles, list skills they can teach, and specify skills they want to learn. Availability preferences will also be included.
Skill-Based Matching – A simple algorithm will match users based on direct keyword comparisons between offered and desired skills.
Session Scheduling & Communication – The platform will feature an integrated scheduling system and a messaging option to help users coordinate learning sessions.
Feedback & Rating System – After each session, users can rate their experience to improve future matches and maintain quality peer interactions.

Innovative Aspects
Reciprocal Learning Model – Every user has the opportunity to be both a learner and a teacher, fostering a dynamic and collaborative learning experience.
Affordable & Accessible – The platform facilitates direct peer connections, eliminating costly learning fees and making knowledge-sharing more inclusive.

System Architecture
SkillSwap will be developed using a three-tier architecture:
Client Tier: The frontend (HTML & CSS) will handle user interactions and display information.
Application Tier: The backend (PHP) will process requests, handle authentication, and manage business logic.
Data Tier: MySQL will store user profiles, skills, schedules, and feedback data securely.


Expected Challenges & Risks
User Adoption – Attracting initial users and encouraging engagement will be a challenge. Mitigation: Launching with an active community and success stories.
Data Privacy – Ensuring the security of user data is crucial. Mitigation: Implementing strong authentication mechanisms and security best practices.
Matching Algorithm Efficiency – The accuracy of the skill-matching algorithm will impact user satisfaction. Mitigation: Refining the algorithm based on user feedback.


Expected Outcomes
By the end of the project, we aim to develop a fully functional prototype of SkillSwap, which will include:
User registration, login, and profile management.
A system for listing offered and desired skills.
A keyword-based matching algorithm for skill pairing.
Session scheduling and an in-platform messaging system.
A post-session rating and feedback mechanism.
